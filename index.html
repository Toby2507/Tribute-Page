                    <p>The tragic death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant at the age of 41 sent shockwaves throughout the world. Bryant and eight
                    other passengers including his 13-year-old daughter Gigi were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bryant will undoubtedly go down as one of the best to ever play the game of basketball. However, not only was the
                    15-time All-NBA performer excellent on the basketball court, but he was also one of the most passionate players in all
                    of sports as well as being the ultimate competitor.</p>
                    
                    <p>These traits showed in Bryant&#8217;s demeanor and the way he spoke. He influenced an entire generation and his impact will
                    absolutely live on far in the future.</p>

                    Mozart had too many notes in his compositions. Let me put it this way: I entertain people who say I shoot too much. I
                    find it very interesting. Going back to Mozart, he responded to critics by saying there were neither too many notes or
                    too few. There were as many as necessary.</strong></p>
